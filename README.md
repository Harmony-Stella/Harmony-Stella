### Hello Guys ðŸ’»

My name is Harmony. Iâ€™m a full stack developer, data analyst, digital project manager, and social media strategist. My hybrid profile allows me to bridge the gap between technical development, data-driven decision making, and digital communication with a results-oriented mindset.

I have hands-on experience building web applications, dashboards, and marketing platforms using technologies like PHP, Symfony, Angular, Flask, WordPress, and Python. Whether itâ€™s designing scalable software, analyzing complex datasets, or managing cross-functional teams, I bring adaptability, precision, and creativity to every project.

Driven by curiosity and committed to delivering value, I thrive at the intersection of tech, strategy, and user experience.

My mission: building meaningful digital solutions that make an impact.
